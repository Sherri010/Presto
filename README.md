Presto is a very easy to use app to quickly find any physical properties of air and water commonly used in convection calculations. The purpose of this application is to allow rapid, easy access to properties of air and water for use in computations of convective heat and mass transfer and energy and mass balance calculations. This app provides the dry air, wet air, freshwater and seawater physical properties for a given temperature, humidity and elevation.
